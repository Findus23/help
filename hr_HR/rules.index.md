Firefly supports "rules", which are small building blocks that can change your transactions.

On this page you see your rule groups, and the rules they contain. If you have no rules or rule groups, Firefly will create a default rule and rule group, as an example.

You can sort the rule triggers, and the rule actions.

If you create a rule, the help page will show you what's possible.
