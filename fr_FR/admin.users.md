This page shows you an overview of all the users in your installation.

Usually, this is just one user.

Every field should be obvious. The "block code" will never be filled in for your own account, but always for others. There are three possible values:

- deleted: user has deleted their account
- bounced: message sent to user has bounced. This is only supported on the demo site.
- expired: user account is too old and has been blocked. This is only supported on the demo site.
