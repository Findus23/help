The configuration options show you some advanced settings for Firefly.

The user administration allows you to manage the users in your Firefly installation, if more people than just yourself use this installation.

The "blocked domains" option is really only there because the demo-site requires such options. You can block domain names so spam accounts are more easily blocked.
