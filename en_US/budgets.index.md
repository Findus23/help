On this page, you can set budgets. Each budget is valid for the current time period only.

First, set the amount that is available to you by clicking the amount next to "_Available in ~~~_". By default, this is â‚¬ 1000,-.

Then, create some budgets using the "New Budget" button. All you need for a budget is a name. Once you've created some budgets you can set the amount of the budget using the input below the name. If you have already spent money in a budget, this will be shown as well.

Both the amount available and the amount budgeted are for a specific period: if you go back a month or forward a month, both of these amounts are reset. Firefly will remember what you've set the amounts to of course, but every period has their own amounts.

In your preferences, you can change this range to be weekly, or even yearly.
