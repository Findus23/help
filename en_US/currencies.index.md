These are the currencies your installation currently supports.

Firefly III is a multi-currency system. You can safely use Dollars and Euros at the same time.

You can freely add new currencies, existing ones or custom ones. Please note that each currency needs:

- A symbol, such as $ or â‚¬ or something else.
- A code, such as EUR or USD or something you make up.
- A name, of course.
