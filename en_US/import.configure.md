This page allows you to configure your import. This page is built dynamically and its content is wildly different depending on what stage you are in.

** Set up CSV files**
CSV files can be imported, but you need to indicate how dates are formatted, if the file has headers or whether or not you want Firefly III to also run rules, or match bills for you.

**Pick roles for columns**
CSV files contain unstructured data, and you must tell Firefly III which column contains what kind of data. You can [download import configurations](https://github.com/firefly-iii/import-configurations) to make this easier.

**Map data to Firefly III**
Let's say your CSV file contains the value "SUPMRKT" and you know it is a transaction that belongs to "Supermarket". You can tell Firefly III to map "SUPMRKT" to "Supermarket".

**Other configuration imports**
Firefly III is always being extended. So maybe you're seeing a configuration page that is not explained here. If you have questions about it, please open a ticket on GitHub!
