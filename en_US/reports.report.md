This page shows you a report. What you see depends on two things:

- The type of report you have selected;
- The date range you have picked;
- The accounts you have selected;
- Any other options available.

**Default financial report**

This reports shows you your expenses, incomes, budget and category information and bill information. When you select a period longer than a year, you will also see your net worth.

**Transaction history overview (audit)**

This report shows you _exactly_ how your accounts have been doing. You can choose which information you wish to see.
