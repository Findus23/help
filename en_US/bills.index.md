Almost everybody has regular expenses that come back every month, quarter or year. In Firefly III, you can register such expenses as "bills".

When you create bills, Firefly III will report on the expected amount of bills for each period of time. These bills will automatically match themselves to transactions so this amounts goes down as the period of time progresses. 

In short, you can create a bill for "rent" or for "insurance" and every month, Firefly III will show you if you paid for it.
