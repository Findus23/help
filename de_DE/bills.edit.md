This page is the same as the "create a new bill"-page.

* The name is descriptive only and is not used internally.
* Use the "matches on" field to save words that will trigger a connection between new transactions and this bill. The "matches on"-field will also trigger on the expense account name. The match is a "AND"-field, meaning every word must be matched for the transaction to match.
* Use the amount (min) and (max) to indicate expected limits for the bill. Any higher or lower amounts will not be matched.
* Automatch indicates whether Firefly will automatically search for matches when you create a new transaction.
* If you enter a number in the "skip" fields, the bill will be automatically skipped every X times; a bill that arrives every 3 months can be entered by filling in "3".
